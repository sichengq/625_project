# Abstract
This study examines the relationship between household income and depression severity among Japanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from 2,708 participants. Depression severity was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and household income was analyzed as a continuous variable. Proportional odds logistic regression showed a significant negative association between household income and depression severity (OR = 0.93, p = 0.046). Machine learning models including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), highlighted additional factors such as age, marital status, and economic impact. These findings emphasize the role of socioeconomic factors in mental health, highlighting the need for targeted interventions during crises.


# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted individuals’ mental health globally, driven by uncertainties and quarantine periods [1]. Due to an unexpected outbreak of an infectious disease, there were insufficient metrics or methods to understand and prevent its spread. Studies have shown that sociodemographic factors, such as income, educational level, and female sex were strongly associated with higher anxiety levels among Germans [2]. Investigating the impact of income on depressive symptoms among Japanese individuals will enhance global understanding of sociodemographic influences on mental health during the pandemic.

# Methods
## Study Population
The data for this study were collected from a longitudinal web-based survey conducted by Macromill, Inc., Japan, spanning from July 2020 to January 2021. The predefined inclusion criteria were participants who were 20 to 69 years old and lived in prefectures under special COVID-19 precautionary measures. The survey targeted Japanese adults to investigate sociodemographic factors and their potential impact on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2,708 participants were included in the analysis.

## Variables
The primary predictor in this study is household income, a key indicator of socioeconomic status that influences one’s mental well-being. Depression severity, the outcome of interest, was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores, ranging from 0 to 27 based on DSM symptom criteria, and categorized into five groups: 'Minimal or None' (0–4), 'Mild' (5–9), 'Moderate' (10–14), 'Moderately Severe' (15–19), and 'Severe' (20–27) [3],[4]. To control for confounding factors, several adjustment covariates were included. These are selected based on the prior literature [5].

## Data Imputation
The missingness mechanism for the income variable was evaluated using the mcar_test() function, which rejected the null hypothesis of Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). Further analysis was conducted using logistic regression, where the missingness indicator (1 = missing, 0 = observed) was modeled as the dependent variable. The results indicated that the probability of missingness was significantly associated with these observed variables, supporting the assumption of Missing at Random (MAR). 

To address this, multiple imputation using the Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) method was applied, generating five imputed datasets. These datasets were pooled using the pool() function to account for the uncertainty introduced by imputation, providing robust estimates for subsequent modeling.

# Models and Statistical Analysis
## Ordinal Logistic Regression
We used an ordinal logistic regression model to examine the relationship between household income, the primary predictor, and depression severity. Depression severity, categorized into five ordered levels based on PHQ-9 scores, was treated as an ordinal outcome. This approach was chosen for its suitability in analyzing ordered categories while adjusting for covariates such as age, employment status, and others to account for their potential influence on the outcome.

## Machine Learning: Extreme Gradient Boosting with Parallel Computing
When preprocessing the data for machine learning, data.table package was utilized to achieve efficient in-place modifications, thereby avoiding redundant data copies and lowering memory usage. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was implemented to predict depression severity, using household income as the primary predictor and other covariates. The XGBoost model was selected for its ability to handle complex relationships and interactions. Data preprocessing involved imputing missing values in household income with the median and encoding categorical variables into numeric formats. Interaction terms, including household income with sex, age, and employment status, were created to capture potential moderating effects. To optimize model performance, we conducted a grid search over a range of hyperparameters, including the number of boosting rounds (nrounds), maximum tree depth (max_depth), learning rate (eta), and others. 

To reduce computation time and efficiently explore the hyperparameter space, parallel computing was implemented using multiple CPU cores. This allowed simultaneous evaluation of hyperparameter combinations during the grid search. Three-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate each hyperparameter combination, selecting the best configuration based on cross-validated accuracy. Probabilities for each class were calculated with the test data, and the model's discriminative ability was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Variable importance was visualized to identify the most influential predictors, providing interpretability for the model's results.



## Shiny App
We have developed a Shiny app to display the results of our predictive modeling, and is accessible at this link: https://depreesionrlincome.shinyapps.io/shiny/. Users can upload their clinical dataset, choose the type of model, and adjust its parameters. Once the data is uploaded, the app generates predictions and provides outputs that include model performance metrics with the variable importance plots.

# Results
The relationship between household income and depression severity during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with other relevant predictors, has been examined by ordinal logistic regression. Household income was negatively associated with depression severity (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1.01, p = 0.046), with statistical significance. This suggests that higher income may reduce the likelihood of severe depression. The model also adjusted for covariates such as age, employment status, and other relevant factors to control for their potential influence.

The tuned XGBoost model demonstrated the best predictive accuracy for depression severity among the models evaluated. The optimized hyperparameters included 150 boosting rounds, a maximum tree depth of 4, a learning rate (eta) of 0.1, a gamma value of 1, a column sampling ratio (colsample_bytree) of 0.7, a minimum child weight of 3, and a subsample ratio of 0.7. These settings minimized overfitting while maintaining high model performance. Model evaluation on the test dataset showed that XGBoost achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE =1.295) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE =1.138), outperforming Random Forest (MSE = 1.304, RMSE = 1.142) and Support Vector Machine (MSE = 1.347, RMSE = 1.161). These results highlight XGBoost's superior ability to model complex relationships and interactions within the data. The variable importance analysis revealed that age, the interaction between income and age (Income_AGE), and economic impact were the most influential predictors of depression severity. Interestingly, household income itself, while included as a key predictor, ranked below these interaction terms and other covariates, suggesting the importance of contextual factors in determining mental health outcomes.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the model's discriminative ability across the five depression severity classes. For the "Severe" depression severity class, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.839, indicating strong model performance in distinguishing this class from others. This result underscores the robustness of the XGBoost model for capturing patterns of severe depression.

# Conclusion
This study investigated the relationship between household income and depression severity among Japanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of statistical and machine learning models. The findings suggest a potential trend that higher income levels may reduce depression severity, as indicated by a proportional odds logistic regression model (OR = 0.93, p = 0.046). The result also highlighted the potential strong protective effect from marriage during crises. Conversely, individuals experiencing economic impact were at a significantly higher risk of severe depression. Integrated programs that combine financial counseling with mental health support can address both the root cause.

The XGBoost model further highlighted the importance of interaction effects between income and other predictors, such as age and employment status, in determining depression severity. The variable importance analysis revealed that age and the interaction between income and age (Income_AGE) were the most influential factors. Mental health professionals can incorporate socioeconomic status and interaction terms as screening tools for identifying individuals at higher risk of depression.

# Limitations
The study relied on a web-based survey, potentially excluding individuals without internet access or technological literacy. This could lead to a sample bias limiting the generalizability of the findings to the broader Japanese population. Additionally, the depression severity and household income were self-reported data. This could potentially introduce recall bias.
